I'm suddenly interested in the C language,Ummm,It's just an idea of something complicated.
I should study well and Learn English,I'm awful in English now，XD.
A few months of waste,Tangled in the Android and computer terminal.
Whether it's mobile terminal or desktop side, I think me should try.
There are some small ideas to explain in the next update,了Although it may not be noticed.（laugh）
Hope to be helped by all of you in the future,I'm going to work hard.
